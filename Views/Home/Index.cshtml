            <p class="lead">Hey there! 😊 I’m a dedicated and detail-oriented software development graduate with a passion for web development, database management, and cybersecurity. Over the years, I’ve mastered various programming languages and developed solid skills in software quality assurance testing and information security. <br><br>

                My journey has been full of exciting learning experiences. I completed Cisco NetAcad courses at Sci-Bono, where I first fell in love with web development. I also had the privilege of studying web development at Southern Labs Institute of Technology, sponsored by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, where I sharpened my skills in HTML5, CSS, and PHP. <br><br>

                Recently, I finished my advanced studies in cybersecurity and visual communications at BCIT. 🎓 It was an amazing journey that expanded my knowledge in cutting-edge technologies, and I’m super excited to apply everything I’ve learned in real-world projects! 🚀 <br><br>

                I thrive in fast-paced environments and love taking on challenges. Whether it’s managing diverse responsibilities or collaborating within teams, I’m always ready to create something extraordinary. Let’s build something awesome together! 💻✨
